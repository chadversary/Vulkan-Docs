This extension provides a new entry point to query the properties of
a tlink:VkImage.
This extension itself, howerver, defines no queryable properties.
Its purpose is similar to that of +VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2+.
It provides a common entry point for other extensions,
thereby eliminating a proliferation of extesnsion-specific entry points.
